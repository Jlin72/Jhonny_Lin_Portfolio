# Jhonny Lin Portfolio
Hello!
Welcome to my portfolio. This repository was created with the sole intention of having all the files required for my portfolio to work on github pages.

# Portfolio progress
This portfolio is still in progress and content will be added or changed as I spend more time learning coding and developing new websites. All of which, will be added to the website for other people to see.

Added a resume and social media to my index.html. 
On my portfolio added a cards that will appear when the user clicks on the images. 
Added images on the portfolio that represents some of my work.

# Build status
This is version 1.1 of the portfolio.

# Resources
The portfolio has been build using bootstrap. Bootstrap was selected due to bootstrap already having media quieries and a responsive layout. The background image used for the site has been obtained from the internet through a google search, and the images used on the about me section were obtained from my own social media site.
