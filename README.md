# Jhonny Lin Portfolio
Hello!and welcome to my portfolio. This repository was created with the sole intention of having all the files required for my repository to work on github pages.

# Portfolio progress
This portfolio is still in progress and content will be added or changed as I spend more time learning coding and developing new websites. All of which, will be added to the website for other people to see.

# Build status
This is version 1.0 of the portfolio

# Resources
The portfolio has been build using bootstrap. Bootstrap was selected due to bootstrap already having media quieries and a responsive layout. The background image used for the site has been obtained from the internet through a google search, and the images used on the about me section were obtained from my own social media site.
